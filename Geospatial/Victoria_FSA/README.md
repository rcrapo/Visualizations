# Description
This geospatial map is an original creation that includes the FSA (Forward Sortation Area) codes of Greater Victoria in British Columbia. The map was created in Qgis (an open source geographic information system platform) and can be used for a variety of situations involving demographic segementation. I imagine that local government has created maps like this to visualize economic and medical data. I originally tried to find this kind of map on the local municipal website, but could not find a map that specifically divided the area by FSA code. 

# Usage
This map is a shape file (.shp) and can be used on multiple platforms in order to derive insights. Tableau is a good platform to use for plug and play. If you want to use Geopandas for this it can be a bit finicky. I suggest you use the conda distribution with a virtual environment. Some of the dependencies would interfere with data analysis in my root environment causing slowdown, shutdown etc. (specifically in jupyter). Installation information for Geopandas can be found [here](https://geopandas.org/install.html) Also, a great video tuorial to help you with virtual environment creation/management for jupyter notebook can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kXLUvsnhuI)
