# Covid-19 cases in British Columbia
This [Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/robert4290#!/vizhome/Covid-19CasesBritishColumbia2020/Covid-19BCDashboard?publish=yes) gives an interactive look at the confirmed cases of Covid-19 in BC. The dashboard breaks down the cases by:

- Age Group
- Gender
- Time (Calendar days)
- Health Authority

Depending where the user clicks they can view the Covid-19 cases through different filters. The legend box to the right of the map can control (check marks) the scope of the virus by Health Authority. Additionally, the user can further filter the data by directly clicking on other charts. This can help the user understand which demographics were affected by HA region and time period. 

This data was pulled from two websites. The geospatial data was pulled from DataBC found [here](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/community-health-service-areas-chsa/resource/f89f99b0-ca68-41e2-afc4-63fdc0edb666) and the Covid-19 data was pulled from the BCCDC found [here](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/data).

IMPORTANT NOTE: This data only pertains to the actual confirmed cases. It does not represent severity or fatalities pertaining to the virus. The focus of this visualisation is to map the progression of the virus by time, area and demographics. It must also be noted that the numbers represent the date of the confirmed case. Some people may have had the virus for a couple of days before they received a test while others may have waited weeks to receive the test. This makes the exact progression of the virus difficult to pinpoint without greater contextual understanding of air travel, public gatherings and local interpersonal interactions. Please heed the council provided by your local health authorities for best personal care during this time.
